You are allowed to work with a partner (if you'd like). Only one partner (or max two per group is allowed). The goal of this mid-semester project is to work with Twitter API to analyze tweets from a person, and in this case, President Donald Trump.  @RealDonaldTrump tweets provide a great opportunity to understand how online media can be used to communicate over the traditional media. Moreoover, Trump tweets has become so consequential, they actually can move the stock market on short term and get network TV to debate and discuss hours and hours about what Trump meant.\n\nWe hope this project will be fun as we can analyze range of emotions, hope, controversy, vagueness that are part of Trump tweets. We are interested in seeing what conclusions you can draw from US Presidents tweets. \n* DISCLAIMER: This project is not designed with any bias in mind. Note that we could pick either candiadate (Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump) or anyone else to do the same analysis. We hope your analysis is objective, independent of any political bias you may have. As Data Scientists, it is our responsiblity to do independent analysis of the data we try to understand. You should follow data and interpret w/o any bias.\n",

You can use an existing account if you have one; if you prefer to not do this assignment under your regular account, feel free to create a throw-away account.\n2. Under account settings, add your phone number to the account.\n3. [Create a Twitter developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply/) by clicking the 'Apply' button on the top right of the page. Attach it to your Twitter account. You'll have to fill out a form describing what you want to do with the developer account. Explain that you are doing this for a class at Rutgers University and that you don't know exactly what you're building yet and just need the account to get started. These applications are approved by some sort of AI system, so it doesn't matter exactly what you write. Just don't enter a bunch of alweiofalwiuhflawiuehflawuihflaiwhfe type stuff or you might get rejected.\n4. Once you're logged into your developer account, [create an application for this assignment](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new).  You can call it whatever you want, and you can write any URL when it asks for a web site.  You don't need to provide a callback URL.\n5. On the page for that application, find your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret.\n6. On the same page, create an Access Token.  Record the resulting Access Token and Access Token Secret.\n7. Edit the file [keys.json](keys.json) and replace the placeholders with your keys.",

So don't give them to anyone, and **don't write them down in this notebook**. \n</span>\nThe usual way to store sensitive information like this is to put it in a separate file and read it programmatically.  That way, you can share the rest of your code without sharing your keys.  That's why we're asking you to put your keys in `keys.json` for this assignment.\n\n\n### Avoid making too many API calls.\n\n<span style=\"color:red\">\nTwitter limits developers to a certain rate of requests for data.  If you make too many requests in a short period of time, you'll have to wait awhile (around 15 minutes) before you can make more.  </span> \nSo carefully follow the code examples you see and don't rerun cells without thinking.  Instead, always save the data you've collected to a file.  We've provided templates to help you do that.\n\n\n### Be careful about which functions you call!\n\n<span style=\"color:red\">\nThis API can retweet tweets, follow and unfollow people, and modify your twitter settings.  Be careful which functions you invoke! </span> It is possible that you can accidentally re-tweet some tweets because you typed `retweet` instead of `retweet_count`. \n</span>\n",

For example, the sentence \"I love America!\" has positive sentiment, whereas the sentence \"I hate taxes!\" has a negative sentiment. In addition, some words have stronger positive / negative sentiment than others: \"I love America.\" is more positive than \"I like America.\"\n\nWe will use the [VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) lexicon to analyze the sentiment of Trump's tweets.

Use the `no_punc` column of `df_trump` to create a table called `tidy_format`. The index of the table should be the IDs of the tweets, repeated once for every word in the tweet. It has two columns:\n\n1. `num`: The location of the word in the tweet. For example, if the tweet was \"i love america\", then the location of the word \"i\" is 0, \"love\" is 1, and \"america\" is 2.\n2. `word`: The individual words of each tweet.\n\nThe first few rows of our `tidy_format` table look like:\n\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>num</th>\n      <th>word</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>894661651760377856</th>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>i</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>894661651760377856</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>think</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>894661651760377856</th>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>senator</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>894661651760377856</th>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>blumenthal</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>894661651760377856</th>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>should</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\nYou can double check that your tweet with ID `894661651760377856` has the same rows as ours. Our tests don't check whether your table looks exactly like ours.\n\nAs usual, try to avoid using any for loops. Our solution uses a chain of 5 methods on the 'trump' DF, albeit using some rather advanced Pandas hacking.\n\n* **Hint 1:** Try looking at the `expand` argument to pandas' `str.split`.\n\n* **Hint 2:** Try looking at the `stack()` method.\n\n* **Hint 3:** Try looking at the `level` parameter of the `reset_index` method.",

A notable example is the slogan like Make America Great Again. As such, it may be beneficial to look at groups of words rather than individual words. For that, we will look at an approach applying a Principal Component Analysis. \n\n### The PCA\nThe Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, is a tool generally used to identify patterns and to reduce the number of variables you have to consider in your analysis. For example, if you have data with 200 columns, it may be that a significant amount of the variance in your data can be explained by just 100 principal components. In the PCA, the first component is chosen in such a way that has the largest variance, subsequent components are orthogonal and continue covering as much variance as possible. In this way, the PCA samples as much of the variability in the data set with the first few components. Mathematically, each component is a linear combination of all the input parameters times coefficients specific for that component. These coefficients, or loading factors, are constrained such that the sum of the squares of them are equal to 1. As such, the loading factors serve as weights describing how strongly certain parameters contribute to the specific principal component. Parameters with large values of positive or negative loading factors are correlated with each other, which can serve to identify trends in your data.",

Are there any spikes in the number of retweets and do the correspond to world events? \n1.
